# The natural logic of language is demonstrated by:
# * Reasoning (in sentences with restricted grammar):
#   - drawing conclusions (more advanced than scientific solutions),
#   - making assumptions (with self-adjusting level of uncertainty),
#   - asking questions about gaps in the knowledge,
#   - displaying justification reports for the self-generated knowledge,
#   - detecting confirmations and conflicts; using self-organizing capabilities;
# * Multilingualism, assuming that languages have a common and logical origin.
