# A summary of the Connect-Four game:
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four,
# Find Four, Fourplay, Four in a Row and Four in a Line) is a two-player
# game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns
# dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column,
# six-row vertically-suspended grid.
# The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space
# within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's
# own discs of the same color next to each other vertically,
# horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

# Initial definitions: Collect specification words.
Every set is A, B, C, D, E, F or G.
Every solve method can-be inverted.
Every solve method can-be busy or done.
Every solve strategy is defensive or exclusive.
Every turn is yours or mine.
A solve level is low or high.

# Solve the problem.
If the set is assigned and the turn is assigned then if the solve method is not busy, the solve method is not done and the game is not draw then the set is empty and solve the game else the set is empty and the solve method is not done.

# Invert the solve method.
If the set is assigned and the turn is assigned then if the solve method is not busy or the solve method is not done then if the solve method is inverted then the solve method is not inverted else the solve method is inverted.

# Display the turn.
If the turn is assigned then if the solve method is not done or the solve method is done, the game is assigned and the game is not invalid then if the turn is yours then display "\nIt's your turn.\n\n".

# Alternate the turn.
If the set is assigned, the turn is assigned and the game is not assigned then if the solve method is not busy or the solve method is not done then if the turn is yours then the turn is mine else display "\nI selected: ~+'set'<a>`~.\n" and the turn is yours.

# Check for a draw game.
